### Lab02.py
This lab investigates the stability of a high and low order ODE solver 
(the Euler Method and the DOP853 RK8 solver from Scipy) when solvinga a
set of coupled equations (the Lotka-Volterra equations) for competition
and predator-prey relationships.

This directory contains the code for Lab 2, which can be executed by running:
```
>>> python3 lab02.py
```


#### Requirements
When developing this code, I use the following packages and versions
* numpy - 1.26.2
* scipy - 1.11.2
* matplotlib - 3.7.2
